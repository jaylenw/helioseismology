Pressure Density Relationship
=============================

About this Directory
--------------------

1.  This folder will have files that will show pressure and density at a given
    radius of the Sun. This is NOT realistic situations.  

2.  Pressure equation:

        P = (G*(M**2))/4*pi*(R**4)

            M = mass of Sun
            R = Radius of Sun

3.  Density equation:

        rho = M/(((4/3)*pi*(R**3))

            M = mass of Sun
            R = Radius of Sun

4.  More details to come.  Work in progress.
