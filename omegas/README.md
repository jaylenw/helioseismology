The Gammas
==========

About this Directory
--------------------

1.  This folder will have two gamma files.  gamma1.py will be a situation where
    the Sun is assumed to be made up of all hydrogen.  I will be using pressure
    and density that I looked up for the Sun.  Let's assume the Sun is made up
    of a monatomic ideal gas, therefore gamma = 5/3.

    (P*V)^gamma = constant, P is pressure, V is volume.

    gamma = ( C_sub(p) / C_sub(v) ) = ( f +2 / f ),

    where f is the number of degrees of freedom of the gas. For monoatomic case,
    the number of degrees of freedom are 3. so (2+3)/3 = 5/3

2.  gamma2.py will be more realistic conditions of the Sun as close as I can
    achieve.

3.  Pictures of the plots will be included in this folder.
