Helioseismology Research
========================

Goal
-----
1. To learn and gather results from calculations of phenomena on the Sun.

2. Sun quakes, caused by forces on the sun cause acoustic, gravity, and surface
   gravity waves.  We study the modes of oscillations that occur to understand
   more about the Sun.

3. Study Sun quakes can give us information about the Sun such as it's
   composition, magnetic fields, temperature, density, luminosity, and in
   general, how the Sun operates.

Updates
-------

  This repository will be updated as research progresses.  Each smaller tasks
  will be divided in directories with an included readme file for the
  description.
